# Wendy Bite

Your client, Wendy, has created "pixel-perfect" images representing how she
wants her website to look, and provided the text. Now she needs an engineer to turn her designs into reality!

## Instructions
Using the starter code found in `./starter_code` and the provided images / text in `./mocks` to create two separate web pages with html and css. The first page will be in `index.html` and will be the "landing page" which is Wendy Bite's "About Me" page. The second page is her resume. Recreate the images as web pages to the best of your ability.


## NOTES
- Use index.html as a starting point for both pages - so you will want to copy the index.html and then retitle it as `resume.html`.
- you can create one `CSS` file for both, or one for each, completely up to you. Link them in your html accordingly.
- look for the filler information in `./mocks`
- ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED!
